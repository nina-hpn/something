# Question 1: Does learning benefit everyone

I don't like to just answer thing with my own perspective although I am the kind of person, who you will see answer all of the questions out of no place. It's not that I do not have something to back up my answer but there is something called forgetting you know :> So if I am incorrect about anything, it's fine, I am a human, and I accept that I can be wrong all the time, and my way of life is to understand what is truly correct. That's why we will have a small section where we list out all the hypotheses that we can think of about the benefit of learning, as well as, checking what people are thinking on the Internet.

## Hypothesis on the benefit of learning

To be fair, before writing this line, I wanted to Google the benefits of learning and whether everyone benefits from it. Although I initially believed that everyone benefited from learning, some opinions suggest otherwise. So, I'll stick to my initial thoughts for now, without experimenting.

1. Acquiring more knowledge -> Understanding the world
2. Seeing the world from a different perspective
3. Improving career prospects and financial well-being
4. Helping others

Personally, I wouldn't say that I'm a great learner, but my grades have been decent since elementary school. I've consistently ranked in the top 10 of my class. I usually understand what's important in school by paying attention to my teachers or reviewing what I've learned.

I'm not sure if others are aware of this. I should probably ask the people I know, so I'll remember to do that.

Although most of the knowledge I've gained has faded since I finished school almost 3 years ago, I did enjoy learning. I believe that for some people, the main incentive for learning is to gain knowledge and understand the world, although I don't think this is the primary motivator for most people.

Having more knowledge allows me to see the world from different perspectives, either more pessimistic or more positive. For instance, I recently watched a short video discussing the Doomsday Clock, which symbolizes the potential extinction of humanity due to technological advancements. The more you know about something, the more it influences your perspective. If you understand the potential devastation of a bomb and the threat it poses to the world, can you truly sit there and remain indifferent as the threat looms? This is an open question for me, but for now, I am content with the insights knowledge brings.

There is a correlation between IQ and financial success, although it's not a direct relationship. IQ represents a person's reasoning ability, which in turn can aid the learning process. This suggests that hard work can overshadow talent. In this case, learning may contribute to greater financial success.

Lastly, knowledge can be used to help others, whether through professions like medicine, education, or other roles that benefit society.
