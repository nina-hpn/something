# Something

Why do people go to school, I have always had something at the back of my mind relating to the topic of learning.

Some people do enjoy learning, but for me, I would say most of the time, I am the kind of person who enjoys reading as well as receiving new information or lessons. But around my life, there are definitely a lot of people who dont like the typical school, they can be really good at their own things, but not the kind that is good sitting in the same place and just writing something out, memorizing it or do some calculation on all of the stats that was given to us.

That truly makes me think, does learning benefit everyone, how can people still do the work that they do without sitting through school, and if there are multiple methods of education, what are those? And who will be the benefitor, suitable for pursuing those ways, and what makes them success in life.

Therefore, in this small place, I will try to answer those questions

1. Does learning benefit everyone?
2. How can people do the work that they do without sitting through school?
3. If there are multiple methods of education, what are those?
4. Who will be the benefitor, suitable for pursuing those ways, and what makes them success in life?

## Open questions to ask people since I am curious

1. How was your study in school? How was it? If you are good in school, what did you did, can you predict what would be there in the exam or test?
